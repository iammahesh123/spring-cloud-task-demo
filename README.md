# Spring Cloud Task Demo

This project demonstrates how to use Spring Cloud Task to create and manage short-lived microservices for batch processing and other tasks.

## Overview

Spring Cloud Task provides a framework for creating and executing short-lived microservices as tasks within a Spring Boot application. These tasks are typically used for batch processing, data migration, or other short-lived operations.

In this demo, we'll showcase how to create a simple Spring Cloud Task application and execute it using Spring Boot.

## Features

- Creation of a Spring Cloud Task application
- Configuration of task properties and execution parameters
- Monitoring and management of tasks using Spring Boot Admin or Actuator

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code for the Spring Boot application.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files and static resources.
- `pom.xml`: Maven project configuration file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iammahesh123/spring-security-CSRF-demo.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

 ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
 ```bash
